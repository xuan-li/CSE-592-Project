# CSE-592-Project: Derivative-free Unconstrained Noisy Convex Optimization

In this project, we will implement three papers:

- [An Accelerated Method for Derivative-Free Smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://github.com/xuan-li/CSE-592-Project/raw/master/Reference/An%20Accelerated%20Method%20for%20Derivative-Free%20Smooth%20Stochastic%20Convex%20Optimization.pdf)
- [Randomized Derivative-Free Optimization of Noisy Convex Functions](https://github.com/xuan-li/CSE-592-Project/raw/master/Reference/Randomized%20Derivative-Free%20Optimization%20of%20Noisy%20Convex%20Functions.pdf)
- [Stochastic First- and Zeroth-order Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Programming](https://github.com/xuan-li/CSE-592-Project/raw/master/Reference/STOCHASTIC%20FIRST-%20AND%20ZEROTH-ORDER%20METHODS%20FOR%20NONCONVEX%20STOCHASTIC%20PROGRAMMING.pdf)

*Stochastic First- and Zeroth-order Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Programming* has first-order method and is for nonconvex functions, but convex functions under its method will converge faster. And we only focus on zeroth-order method of this paper.
