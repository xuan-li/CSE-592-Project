# CSE-592-Project: Derivative-free Unconstrained Noisy Convex Optimization

In this project, we will implement three paper, which can be found [here](https://github.com/xuan-li/CSE-592-Project/tree/master/Reference/Same%20Assumption):

- [An Accelerated Method for Derivative-Free Smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization](Reference/An Accelerated Method for Derivative-Free Smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization.pdf)
- Randomized Derivative-Free Optimization of Noisy Convex Functions
- Stochastic First- and Zeroth-order Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Programming

*Stochastic First- and Zeroth-order Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Programming* has first-order method and is for nonconvex functions, but convex functions under its method will converge faster. And we only focus on zeroth-order method of this paper.
